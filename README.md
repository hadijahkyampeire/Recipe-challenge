## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

A working web browser and or a pc.
If you wish to clone the repo please satisfy the requirements in the requirements.txt

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

```

apt-get install virtualenv
apt-get install -f 

##Navigate to cloned repo
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
##You should now see an environment inside you terminal with (venv)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 app.py

#you should now see a local host 127.0.0.1:5000
Navigate to the local host with your favorite browser

#run

pip3 install pytest

pytest /path/to/repo

### Breaking down the tests

        self.assertNotEqual(userdata[self.Sir3n.user_id]['password'], 'Kali2017', msg='Password is not encrypted')
```
````
### Need for test
